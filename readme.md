# Hoops: Court Rating Webapp

This application aims to use React to handle front-end components, Express to handle back-end routing, and PostgreSQL to handle information in order to provide an application that allows a user that is interested in their community's local basketball courts to rate and browse nearby basketball courts.

## Getting Started

For development, clone the repository into a directory on your machine using:

```
git clone <repository link>
```

### Installing

First, run ```npm install``` in the root directory of the repository to install the dependencies required for the back-end functionality.

You'll notice a ```config.json``` file in the root directory; replace the template with your database information so that you are able to make a connection when the application runs.

Next, navigate into the ```client``` directory, and do ```npm install``` in order to install the dependencies required for the React components.

Head to your terminal and execute 

```
yarn dev
```

to run an instance of the webkit on your localhost. Connect to the host as specified by your terminal and develop away.
